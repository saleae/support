### **More Protocol Analyzers**

Some Logic users have created their own protocol analyzers. The following list of analyzers are available but not officially supported by Saleae.

### **Do all Saleae logic analyzer models support these protocols?**

Yes. However, you will need to use a device with sufficient bandwidth to record the original signal. For instance, Logic 4 simply does not have the bandwidth required to capture and decode USB full speed. Logic 4 has a maximum digital bandwidth of 3 MHz, and USB full speed requires a digital bandwidth of at least 12.5 MHz.
