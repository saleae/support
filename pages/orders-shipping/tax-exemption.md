If your company is exempt from paying taxes and our product will ship to within the United States, you can provide your tax exemption certificate to us.

## Process for Removing Tax Charges

1. Before placing your order, [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let us know you would like sales tax removed on future orders. Include an attachment of your tax exemption certificate.
2. If approved, we will send confirmation.
3. Afterwards, your future orders on [www.saleae.com](https://www.saleae.com/) will be tax-free.

## Refund of Tax Charges

If the order has already shipped, then the sales tax has already been collected. Please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach your tax exemption certificate. After approval, we can provide a refund of the tax charges. We can only process tax refunds for orders placed directly on our website at [www.saleae.com](https://www.saleae.com/).
