Click the **Start** button to begin recording data from the logic analyzer, and let the software finish processing data before analyzing it. Note that if you do not have the logic analyzer plugged into your computer, the button will instead say **Start Simulation**, which will use simulated data and allow you to learn the software before connecting hardware.
