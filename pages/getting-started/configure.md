With the analyzer plugged into your computer, start the _Logic_ software. If this is the first time you are using your logic analyzer, the _Logic_ software will automatically download a calibration file for your particular analyzer. If you do not have access to the Internet, refer to the [Device Calibration](https://saleae.gitbook.io/docs/user-guide/device-calibration) section of the User Guide.

Before you capture any data, click on the _Device Settings_ button to configure the logic analyzer. Select the sampling rate, collection duration, ports, and voltage.

Note: only the Logic 8 Pro and Logic 16 Pro have the "Voltage" setting.
